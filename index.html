            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Shamitha Shankar Achar, a Computer Science student currently pursuing my degree at Canara Engineering College. My passion for technology and problem-solving drives me to explore the vast world of software development, data structures, and algorithms. As I continue to build my academic foundation, I’m particularly interested in artificial intelligence, web development, and machine learning.</p>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience through various projects, where I’ve applied my knowledge in programming languages like Python, Java, or C++, software development methodologies, and database management. I enjoy taking on challenges that require innovative thinking and a strong grasp of computational theory.</p>
            <p>I am actively involved in extracurricular activities which have further honed my technical skills and fostered my ability to work collaboratively in a team setting. These experiences have also enhanced my understanding of how technology can be leveraged to solve real-world problems.</p>
            <p>As I progress in my studies, I’m eager to expand my knowledge through internships and collaborative projects that will allow me to apply my skills in a professional environment. I’m particularly interested in opportunities that will challenge me to think critically and develop solutions that are both innovative and efficient.</p>
            <p>I’m always open to connecting with professionals and peers who share my passion for technology. If you’re looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic Computer Science student to contribute to your team or project, I’d be excited to connect and explore how we can work together.</p>
